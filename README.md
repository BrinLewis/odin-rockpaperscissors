# odin-rockpaperscissors
Part of the Odin Project. Creating my first JavaScript program from scratch.

In this project my aim is to create a fully functional game of rock-paper-scissors that you can play in the console vs the computer.
To achieve this I will have to use most if not all (and maybe a little extra) of my recently learned JavaScript knowledge.

The main thing I want to do with this project is prove to myself my problem-solving abilities and show my strength in properly tackling problems with ensuring a good understanding of said problems before planning them out and eventually coding them.

I shall hopefully also display clear understandings of some basic JS principles such as:
Creating, asigning and chaning variables using let and const,  
Using arithmetic, assignment and comparison operators,  
Making use of operator precedence,  
Including a wide range of data types,  
Conditional statements such as if, else, else if and switch,  
Logical operators ||OR, &&AND and !NOT,  
Declaring and calling functions both built-in and custom,  
Function scope.


Note that not all of the listed principles will be included in the code, however I aim to make it so that the majority are and make it clear to see that I have gained a good grasp of all of these conecpts, even if not presented in the code itself.
