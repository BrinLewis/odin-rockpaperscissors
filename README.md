# odin-rockpaperscissors
Part of the Odin Project. Creating my first JavaScript program from scratch.  

In this project my aim is to create a fully functional game of rock-paper-scissors that you can play in the console vs the computer.  
To achieve this I will have to use most if not all (and maybe a little extra) of my recently learned JavaScript knowledge.  

The main thing I want to do with this project is prove my problem-solving abilities and show my strength in properly tackling problems with ensuring a good understanding of said problems before planning them out and eventually coding them.  

I shall also display clear understandings of some basic JS principles such as:  
Creating, asigning and changing variables using let,  
Using arithmetic, assignment and comparison operators,  
Making use of operator precedence,  
Including a range of data types,  
Template literals,  
Conditional statements such as if, else, else if and switch,  
For loops,  
Logical operators &&AND,  
Declaring and calling functions both built-in and custom,  
Function scope.
